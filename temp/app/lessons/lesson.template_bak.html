        <h3>Introduction</h3>
A neural network is a statistical model which tries to copy a simplified human brain. It has densely interconnected cells which learn, recognize patterns, and make decisions based on past experience. Most information on neural networks are math-dense with pre-requisites of calculus and linear algebra to understand. While there will be some math it'll be sparse. The main focus of this course is to interact and understand the basic data structures from a programmer's perspective, using the language of the web, javascript. We will first build up each step then in later modules use brain.js a feed-forward network and later ConvNet a convolutional network. Don't worrry there'll be jargon but it'll all be explained in practical terms.
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Curiosity, algebra and for the later modules intermediate javascript. If you know basic javascript feel free to get started, but know that further research might be needed. For the math, we'll start with algebra but we'll teach you what you need to know to understand what's going on and how to code it.
<h3>What are they used for?</h3>
Neural networks are best used for problems which humans are good at, such as image recognition, but that it is difficult to create rules. Basically, it's very difficult to write with if blocks and for loops what a cat looks like but by parsing the input information into small enough blocks and defining your problem a certain way the program can learn a statistically sound way of guessing what's a cat and what's a turtle.

<h3> Type of neural networks</h3>
There is no list here as each one that is covered will be introduced. As you gain more knowledge the names of each type become self-explanatory. The base type of neural network covered will be a supervised feed-forward neural network which will categorize items. Supervised means that we will be feeding the network data with labels and expecting an outcome where there are correct answers and a deviation from those answers can be calculated. Feed forward means that information flows in a single direction from input towards output. 
<h3>Neurons, the building blocks</h3>

 This is what a human neuron looks like. It takes inputs through the dendrites, some chemical process take place inside the cell body, and the resulting signal is sent out through the axon terminals.

Our model for an artificial neuron is similar. IT takes input values, some process are done, such as a summation function, and an activation function which transforms the data which is then outputted.

The summation function takes the initial value and multiplies it by weights(not shown), the activation function transforms the values to have a linear relationship. The weights are a little black magic even in more sophisticaed neural networks. For this example let's assume that a step is either -1 or 1.

Each input layer is an array with values. The weights are also in an array with the same number of values as the input array and they are multiplied and added together to come up with the sum.

What this means in code is:
<pre><code>
var input = [4, 12];
var weight = [0.5, -1]
var sum;

for(var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
  sum =+ // leave the rest as an exercise for the reader
}

//Once we have the sum, we can apply the simple activation function which acts as
//the threshold.
if(sum > 0) {
  return 1
} else {
  return -1
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Perceptons</h3>
Neurons are categorized by the types of transformations to do on their input data and on what the allowable values are. Perceptons are among the simplest. They take 0 and 1 as inputs and as outputs. The activation function for perceptons such as binary classifier which are commonly denoted as a step. The primary use case of perceptrons is teaching. It was one of the first neruons described and is foundational to understanding how thigns work without higher order math.<a href="http://www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Perceptron_moj.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-252 size-full" src="http://www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Perceptron_moj-e1449528075665.png" alt="Perceptron_moj" width="142" height="115" /></a>
<h3>"And" function and you</h3>
You actually know enough to compute your own activation function. Let's walk through a simple example. The And function. Mapping out a function is called a truth table, lets treat the numbers as booleans.
<pre><code>
| X | Y | result|
| 0 | 0 | 0
| 0 | 1 | 0
| 1 | 0 | 0
| 1 | 1 | 1 </code></pre>
For the "and" function the result is only true when both x and y are 1. As expected this only happens once. Separating the results would be a classifcation problem. Another way to look at the same data is in a chart.
<a href="http://www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/andchart.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254" src="http://www.lesliepajuelo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/andchart-300x160.png" alt="andchart" width="300" height="160" /></a> The only reason we can solve this problem is because it is linear in nature and the expected outputs are 0 and 1. A threshold is chosen, in this case 0.5 where anything that equals it will be categorized as a 1, otherwise a 0.
